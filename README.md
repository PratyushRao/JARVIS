JARVIS is an AI-powered personal assistant designed to bridge the gap between intelligence and execution. Unlike conventional assistants that stop at conversation, JARVIS extends its capabilities into your local operating system—opening applications, managing system controls, navigating the web, and responding visually to the world around it.

At its core, JARVIS is a modular, locally-aware AI system that combines cloud-level reasoning with on-device control. It listens, understands, decides, and does things—bringing the concept of a truly functional AI assistant closer to reality.
